Fidibo Object Collision Game
This Flutter project is a simple object collision game developed for Fidibo. The game features three types of objects: scissors (shown with red containers and letter S), rocks (shown with grey containers and letter R), and papers (shown with white containers and letter P). The objective of the game is to handle collisions between objects based on their types.
